    <p> My name is <span class= "important">Doyo Abdikadir Doyo</span> and i am pure breed Kenyan. Well not entirely, i have spent 5 years of my life in Pakistan, Islamabad.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated school. I was studying in the british system also known as Cambridges International Examinations.</p>
    <p> I am now taking a gap year before i join university in September 2022. I thought about the skills that look good on a personal profile while applying to University, and having a strong foundation in software development is really impressive to an admission council especially if your choosen course is engineering, and thats why i joined <span class="important">Moringa.</span> </p>
