    <p> I am very new to programming hence i have no projects. </p>
    <p> My name is Doyo Abdikadir Doyo and i am pure breed Kenyan. Well not entirely, i spent 5 years of my life in Pakistan, Islamabad.</p>
    <p>I recently graduated school. I was studying the british system also known as Cambridge International Examinations.</p>
    <p> I am now taking a gap year before i join university in September 2022. I thought about what was gonna look good on my personal profile while applying to University and having a strong base for software development is really impressive to an admission council, and thats why i joined Moringa. </p>
    <p> I enjoy doing the following in my free time:</p>
    <ul> 
        
         <li> Gym </li>
         <li> Football</li>
         <li> Swimming</li>
         <li> Cooking/Meal prep</li>
         <li> Video games</li>
    
        </ul>
       
       
        <p>Thats basically all about me in a nutshell. Thanks for reading</p>
